Xigxag
======

This is the reference distribution for the Xigxag string-copying automaton.

For a definition of the Xigxag automaton, see the file `xigxag.html` in
the `doc` directory.  (I didn't convert it from HTML to Markdown because
it has a lot of mathematical-type markup, like subscripts and superscripts,
that don't have equivalents in core Markdown, and the main advantage of it
being in Markdown is so that it can be viewed directly on Github and
Bitbucket.  It should probably be converted to some more mathematically-
oriented markup language at some point, I suppose.)

This distribution also contains an "interpreter" for Xigxag, written in
Perl, as `xigxag.pl` in the `src` directory.

All of these materials are in the public domain; see the file UNLICENSE
in the distribution's root directory for more information.
